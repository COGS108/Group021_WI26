    "Throughout the existence of Major League Baseball, there have been increased investments into franchises to create more revenue by having more competitive teams. MLB owners often invest money into star players to bring attention and fans to their team, which makes them profit and repeats this cycle. One of the main metrics to record how well a team is doing, is if they are able to make the League’s playoffs, which only a select group of teams make. All with the ultimate goal of winning the World Series Championship.\n",
    "\n",
    "To measure the predictability of a team’s chances of making the playoffs, there are projections created by a mixture of team statistics intertwined with individual players’ statistics. Throughout Prior Work that we found, each publication of the research started with defining what the Benchmarks for the data analysis were <a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2), and what features to create the prediction from. The most common ones were from the Final Project at Stanford, created by Randy Jia, Chris Wong, and David Zeng, where they selected BA, RBI, OBP, ERA, H, E, and Win% for each team to be the metrics they used in their predictive model. They found that these metrics were representative of the state of each MLB team within their respective time frame.<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2)\n",
    "\n",
    "Dr. Gregory Wood and David Marmor created an inferential model about correlations between teams' statistics during the regular season versus team statistics during the playoff season. <a name=\"cite_ref-4\"></a>[<sup>4</sup>](#cite_note-4) In this, they compared stats like a team’s regular season wins versus their playoff wins, playoff ERA vs. playoff wins, playoff net runs vs playoff wins, and playoff allowed runs vs playoff wins. In these comparisons, they found an intriguing conclusion that the correlation coefficient for these datasets was extremely close to 0, meaning they had no linear correlation for teams. Which meant that they came to the conclusion that their stats for playoff teams were not directly correlated, and that a randomness factor comes into play for the playoffs. Although this type of analysis is similar to what we will do in this project, it is not directly tied, because this research group only used data from the playoffs, comparing it also to the playoffs, whereas we will use early regular season data and compare it to how the playoff entries turned out. Not using a predictive model, but instead an analysis of whether there was a correlation.\n",

    "We expect that MLB teams with a higher run differential per game and OPS, along with lower pitching ERA over the first 81 games, will have a higher chance of qualifying for the playoffs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Among these metrics, we expect the run differential to be the strongest indicator of success (defined as qualifying for the playoffs), as it reflects overall team performance by incorporating both offensive and defensive contributions, while OPS and ERA capture specialized aspects of performance. We further hypothesize that the predictive strength of all three metrics will increase by the end of the regular season as team performance stabilizes and early-season variability decreases."
